# sum.exe
## prompt db "The result", 0
at c: char prompt[] = "The result"
"0" in the end is '\0'
in asm: db: define byte(char)
dw: define word
dd: define double word

## result db 100 dup(0)  == char result[100] = {0};
dup: means repeat
so all the result is 0

## .data
all the definition of variable starts from here

## .code
all the code starts from here

## ";" 
it means the start of interpret

## invoke
invoke is not an asm instruct, it is not an CPU instruct "伪指令"
it can be understood as micro"宏"
invoke wsprintf, offset(addr also can be used here) result, offset format, eax == wsprintf(&result[0], &format[0], eax)
after micro
it is:
```
	push eax
	push offset format
	push offset result
	push 0
	call wsprintf
cause eax = 5050
```
so:
​	result[0] = '5'
​	result[1] = '0'
​	result[2] = '5'
​	result[3] = '0'
​	result[4] = '\0'
BTW, it is an API provided by windows

invoke MessageBox, 0, offest result, offset prompt, MB_OK
the second parameter is the main title
the third parameter is 

## ret
it is very important

## end main
it provides the entrance of the code

#hello, world in 0x10 system
data segment
    //start of data, data作为段的名字，在代码中引用它表示该段的段地址, it will be proved later
    ds: must be the start of data, so we need to mov ax, data; mov ds ax; it can alos be written by seg abc(the start of sagment), it might not be 0
    dx: must be at "$", as the offset of abc(also the start of abc), dx与ds一起，表示偏移地址, like the seg start is 0x100, dx is 0x2, so the address of abc is 0x102
    in 16 system, to find the address, DS * 16 + DX
abc db "hello, world!", 0Dh, 0Ah, "$"  
    //0D0A:'\n'(0x13 0x10, h is a postfix"后缀") "$"means the end of the string, echo to "\0"
```assembly
data ends
    //end of segment
code segment
main:
	mov ax, data
	mov ds, ax
	mov ah, 9
	mov dx, offset abc
	int 21h
	mov ah, 4Ch
	int 21h
code ends
end main

	mov ds, ax
	mov ah, 9
	mov dx, offset abc
	int 21h
```
int 21h: 中断指令
in the 21h, 09 is to print the string, so it is to show the string "hello, world"
in the 21h, 4ch is to exit(0)
to search it, we can input "intview" in dosbox, then input "2109" to see the declaration of the function

to asm .asm in cmd:
	masm hello;
	link hello;
	hello
